<bigger>Drawer Controller</bigger>

Two features are supported: Ejecting items from drawers and getting information about the items in the drawers.

<big>Ejecting</big>
Send it an itemstack in a string form like "sbz_resources:matter_blob 69" and it will send that matter blob stack out of the drawer controller from nearby drawers.
<mono>send_to(links.drawercontroller,{
$C1    type = "eject",
$C1    item = "sbz_resources:matter_blob 69"
})</mono>

<big>Getting items</big>
<mono>send_to(links.drawercontroller,{
$C1    type = "get_items",
})</mono>
