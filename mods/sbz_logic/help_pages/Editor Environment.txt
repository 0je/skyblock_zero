<bigger>Editor Environment</bigger>

<mono>editor</mono> - same as main sandbox
<mono>turn_off()</mono> - turns off main sandbox
<mono>turn_on()</mono> - turns on main sandbox
<mono>coroutine_env</mono> - if turned on, the editor can access the entire main sandbox environment with this table
<mono>event</mono> - instead of doing that yielding stuff, the code is re-executed every time an event happens
