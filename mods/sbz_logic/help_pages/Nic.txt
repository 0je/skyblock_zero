<big>Nic</big>

The same thing as the digistuff nic.
<b>By default, it is not avaliable, to enable it, please add sbz_logic_devices to your secure.http_mods setting!</b>
<b>By default, it is locked to the nic_user priv, if you wish for it to be avaliable to anyone, you can disable it in the settings</b>

So... with that out of the way... how to actually use it...

You can send it:
A: a string, it will just request that url
B: a table with the field <mono>url</mono> and optionally a boolean <mono>parse_json</mono> field. If parse_json is enabled it will try to parse it.

You will receive a result...
<mono>
{
$C1    completed = bool,
$C1    succeeded = bool,
$C1    data = string|table, -- depending if you specified parse_json
$C1    timeout = bool,
$C1    code = integer,
}
</mono>

And yea, that's it

Ideas for you (duable even if you are in some server and you have the privs):
- use it to offload computations from your luacontroller to your own server (you can set it up for free with playit and your computer)
- use it with some API
- modify <action url=https://github.com/TheEt1234/minetest-virt>minetest-virt</action> to send the formspec over to your server, get the formspec with nic, and serve that on a formspec screen
