<big>Buttons and Toggles</big>

Ok so, a button... yea

You can send it "subscribe" or "unsubscribe" depending on what you want, to receive events from the button

they will take in the form of a boolean saying true, always, and yeah.

As for toggles, if you send them ANYTHING they will send over their status (either true or nil). And the player can yea, toggle them.
