<big>Matrix Screen</big>

Called that because it accepts a 2D matrix.
It has a variable resolution ranging from 1x1 to 32x32.
Can detect "clicks".
This is almost exactly the same as digiscreens, even shares code. (but mine is slightly better :>)

So, you can send it a 2D matrix like this:
<mono>
$C1{
$C1    {<any colorspec>, <any colorspec>, ... (up to 32 times), <any colorspec>},
$C1    {<any colorspec>, ..., <any colorspec>},
$C1    ... <up to 32 times>
$C1    {<any colorspec>, ..., <any colorspec>}
$C1} 
</mono>

Colorspec = string or integer or table color, just any color format you can think of, even saying "lime" works 

There may be holes in the sub-tables but there can't be in the main table.
Resolution is determined by how many sub-tables there are in the main table.

You send it the string "subscribe" for the luacontroller to be notified when someone clicks the screen.
The event will look like this:
<mono>
$C1{
$C1    x = <integer>, -- with this being the x coordinate on the screen that the player clicked on
$C1    y = <integer>, -- with this being the y coordinate...
$C1    player = <player name: string>
$C1}
</mono>

Ideas for what you can make with this:
- Bad apple
- Conways game of life
- some REALLY COOL in-world ui
