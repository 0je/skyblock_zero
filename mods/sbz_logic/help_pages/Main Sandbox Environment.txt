<bigger>Main Sandbox Environment</bigger>
<<<<<<< HEAD
Based off of the standard libox environment

<big> Definitions</big>
Relative position/rpos - offset from the luacontroller's position
Link - <mono>{[1] = relative position 1, [2] = relative position 2, ..., [n] = relative position n}</mono>

Converting a position to link is trivial, just do <mono>{ [1] = pos }</mono>

<big>The actual environment</big>
<mono>editor</mono> - through a metatable metatable, this allows you to get and edit:
$C1     <mono>editor.formspec</mono> - the formspec of the editor
$C1     <mono>editor.editor_code</mono> - the editor code
$C1     <mono>editor.code</mono> - the normal code
$C1     <mono>editor.error</mono> - the error that happened in main code (can be edited, wouldnt recomend as you dont know what the editor will do with it)

<mono>origin</mono> - <mono>vector.new(0,0,0)</mono> - in relative coordinates, this is the position to itself
<mono>pos</mono> - the in-world/non-relative position of the luacontroller
<mono>yield</mono> - <mono>coroutine.yield</mono>

<mono>missed_events = wait_for_event_type(event_type)</mono> - yields until the <mono>event.type</mono> of the event is equal to <mono>event_type</mono>, the last event (<mono>misssed_events[#missed_events]</mono>) is that event type
<mono>missed_events = wait(t)</mono> - sends a wait yield command, then calls <mono>wait_for_event_type("wait")</mono>

<mono>ok, errmsg = send_to(link_or_relative_position, "Something :D")</mono>
- allows you to send information to all positions of a link (or just a single position)
- you can even send_to(origin, "Something") to loop-back and send it to yourself
- You can only send 20 kilobytes of information, and only the basic (anythings thats NOT NaN (1/0 and similar), coroutine, function, userdata) types are allowed, rest get replaced as nil
- Range is limited by linking range
resulting event is (when you send to yourself or something replies):
<mono>{
$C1    from_pos = <whatever position you sent to, if you sent to a link, some position of that link will be returned>,
$C1    msg = <whatever was sent to you>,
$C1    type = "receive"
}</mono>

<mono>node, errmsg = get_node(pos)</mono> - gets a node (table of <mono>{ param1 = int, param2 = int, name = "sbz_resources:poo_or_whatever_idk" }</mono>), limited to linking range
<mono>boolean = is_protected(pos[, someone_else])</mono> - checks if that position is protected to the owner, optionally with the second argument, it can check if it's protected to someone else, not limited by linking range

<mono>traceback = full_traceback()</mono> - alias for debug.traceback, experimental but shouldnt be harmful

<mono>ok, errmsg = turn_off_machine(pos)/turn_on_machine(pos)</mono> - forcefully turns on/off a machine, limited to linking range

Also, the basic editor that is in the systemdisk, cares about the global <mono>terminal_text</mono>
If you do <mono>terminal_text = "helloo world"</mono> it will display "helloo world" on the terminal
