Areas have been slightly modified
as of this writing, core.is_protected is 10x faster than in vanilla areas, see https://github.com/minetest-mods/areas/issues/86, so don't be afraid to use it
Also i've added the PvP controlling system from blocky survival, see pvp.lua.
And regular players cannot make areas without the areasprotector to help them.
Besides that, that should be it...
