So... epidermis does support skinsDB, it's just that you need to have https://bitbucket.org/kingarthursteam/mt-skin-db/src/master/ and give it trust to use the http api???

Otherwise, **skinsDB and epidermis should not mix**
ill also copy what the code comments say in case you actually want to have skinsDB:
--[[
Assumptions:
- Skins are usually added
- Skins are rarely removed by the admin / hoster
- Skins are never changed
- `GROUP BY` works like `ORDER BY` (otherwise no ordering is guaranteed)
]]

good luck
And also, it may be a horrible idea to delete skinsDB in the future, that may break the paintables
