So, i define a corrupted machine as a machine that has its metadata and inventory lists wiped for any reason
If you can create a corrupted machine, that's a serious bug and you should report it (duh)
These machines usually also crash the server


How to get rid of corrupted machines:
- Attempt to identify where they are, if they crash the server, they usually crash only when players get near it
- Use `/toggle_power false` to disable switching stations, so they can't crash the server
- Just remove them
- Enable machines by doing `/toggle_power true`
